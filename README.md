## Reflection

### Context
This project was built to practice handling side effects and state management in React. It focuses on effectively using the `useEffect` hook and integrating React side effects like local storage and geolocation.

### What I Set Out to Build
I aimed to build a functional app that dynamically updates based on geolocation and user interaction while deepening my understanding of:
  - **State Management**: Using `useState` to track modal state, selected places, and sorted places.
  - **Side Effects**: Leveraging `useEffect` for geolocation and persistent local storage.
  - **Reusable Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, functional components like `Places`, `Modal`, and `DeleteConfirmation`.
  - **User Interaction**: Providing a seamless and intuitive experience for selecting and managing places.

### Challenges
One challenge was effectively using `useEffect` to fetch and sort places by geolocation. Another challenge was managing the synchronization between local storage and React state to ensure data persistence.

## Libraries and Frameworks Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the application state.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for responsive and clean UI.
- **Browser Geolocation API**: To fetch the userâ€™s location and sort places dynamically.
